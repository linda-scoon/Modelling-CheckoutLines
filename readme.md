<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
Learning how to use linked lists, queues and stacks. This was an assignment for the module datastructures and algorithms. It is a program that represents checkoutlines. The people go to the shortest queue then leave one by one. People are added by clicking a button.

I later attempted to make a visual representation which never worked out so good cause the people dont appear in the correct queue at the exact time.

Maybe I'll debug it one day.
